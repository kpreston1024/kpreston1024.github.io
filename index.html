Hello everyone! My name is Kayla Preston. I'm from Charlottesville, Virginia, but I live in Martinsville, Virginia. This is my second semester as a graduate student studying Computer Science in order to get my Masters degree. I'm taking CS620 because its a requirement for me degree and I want to learn more about data science.
